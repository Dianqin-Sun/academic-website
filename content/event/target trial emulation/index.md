In this journal club, I discussed the paper "Continuation of Annual Screening Mammography and Breast Cancer Mortality in Women Older Than 70 Years". Using this paper as an excellent example, I discussed the framework of target trial emulation. The {{% staticref "target trial emulation.pptx" "newtab" %}}slide{{% /staticref %}} is in Chinese.
