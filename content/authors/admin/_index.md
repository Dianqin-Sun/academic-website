I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center. Originally from Shandong, China, I completed eight years of medical and public health training in Beijing, culminating in a Master's degree in Epidemiology from Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University. 

My research is primarily focused on gastric cancer prevention. I am currently engaged in the CISNET-Gastric Cancer project, utilizing causal inference and simulation methods to address emerging questions related to gastric cancer control. Additionally, I will evaluate the effectiveness of gastric cancer prevention policies in the Chinese context. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring history, traveling with friends, and capturing moments through photography. By the way, I love existentialism and admire Sartre and SU Dongpo.
