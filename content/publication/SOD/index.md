abstract: "Background\: The association between superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and cognitive decline in older adults remains controversial.

Objectives\: This study was designed to examine the association between plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and cognitive decline in older population.

Method\: We analyzed the follow-up data from 2012 to 2014 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), a community-based longitudinal survey in Chinese longevity areas. A total of 1004 Chinese adults aged 60 years and older were included in this study. Plasma SOD activity was assessed. Cognitive function was evaluated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in Chinese version. Modified Poisson regression was performed to investigate the association between plasma SOD activities with cognitive decline. Restricted cubic spline was performed to determine the dose-response relationship.

Results\: Participants in the highest quartile of SOD activity had an increased risk of cognitive decline compared with those in the lowest quartile (relative risk [RR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.74, P = 0.051).Using cut-off points determined by Chi-square automatic interaction detector analysis (CHAID), the multivariable relative risks (RRs; 95% CI) for the lowest category, second highest, and the highest versus the third highest category of SOD activity were 0.56 (0.34-0.92), 1.26 (1.03-1.54), and 0.96 (0.70-1.31), respectively.

Conclusions\: Higher SOD activity was associated with elevated risk of cognitive decline among Chinese older adults."
