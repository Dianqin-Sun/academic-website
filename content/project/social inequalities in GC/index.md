Reducing social inequalities in cancer has been the leading topic in countries and international agencies. Educational inequalities in gastric cancer (GC) have been well established and seen as a typical case of social disparities in cancer prevention. The most recent meta-analysis found that people with a high level of education had a 40% lower risk of GC than individuals with a low level. 

##Applied causal mediation analysis to identify intervention targets for reducing social inequalities in gastric cancer
Given the existing evidence, individuals with low education are more likely to have a higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle risk factors. Furthermore, a healthy lifestyle has a strongly reverse relationship with GC risk. Therefore, it is plausible to expect that healthy lifestyle promotion could reduce gastric cancer burden from educational inequalities, which could have significant public health benefits. However, few studies have examined the contribution of health behaviors to the educational gap. Therefore, we aim to quantify the contribution of health behaviors to educational inequalities in GC by applying the causal mediation analysis.  The ultimate goal is to identify intervention targets for reducing social inequalities in GC.
